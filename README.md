I made this little program because I'm trying to learn Haskell.  I have some limited programming experience in Python, HTML, and a bit of C++ decades ago but not a lot.
This is my first time working with a functional language and I'm really enjoying it so far. I do pick things up quickly though when I'm motivated and I'm very motivated
to learn as much as I can about Haskell so I can work somewhere within the Cardano ecosystem.    

I do have a not-crypto-related IT day job so this is probably going to take a while as I have to divide my time.  
I'm always open to any feedback or help anyone is willing to provide.  Thanks in advance!
